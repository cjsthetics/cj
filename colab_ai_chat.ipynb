            "AI:  \"Chiranjiv\" (or \"Chiranjeevi\") is a multifaceted term, primarily of Sanskrit origin, with several significant meanings and associations, especially in Indian culture:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Meaning and Origin:**\n",
            "    *   **Sanskrit Origin:** The word \"Chiranjiv\" is derived from Sanskrit.\n",
            "    *   **Etymology:** It combines two words:\n",
            "        *   **\"Chiram\" (चिरम्):** meaning \"long time,\" \"forever.\"\n",
            "        *   **\"Jeevi\" (जीवी):** meaning \"one who lives,\" \"living.\"\n",
            "    *   **Overall Meaning:** Therefore, \"Chiranjiv\" literally means **\"one who lives long,\" \"immortal,\" or \"ever-living.\"**\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Cultural and Mythological Significance:**\n",
            "    *   **Hindu Mythology:** In Hinduism, \"Chiranjeevi\" refers to the **eight immortals** who are believed to live eternally until the end of the current Kali Yuga. These are:\n",
            "        1.  Ashwatthama\n",
            "        2.  King Mahabali\n",
            "        3.  Vyasa\n",
            "        4.  Hanuman\n",
            "        5.  Vibhishana\n",
            "        6.  Kripacharya\n",
            "        7.  Parashurama\n",
            "        8.  Markandeya (sometimes Dronacharya's son Ashwatthama is replaced by other figures depending on the tradition)\n",
            "    *   **Blessing/Honorific:** It is often used as a blessing or an honorific term, especially for younger people, wishing them a long and prosperous life. For example, \"Chiranjeev Bhaava\" (चिरंजीव भव) means \"May you live long.\" It's common in formal invitations (like weddings) to refer to the bride and groom as \"Chiranjeevi\" to invoke blessings for a long and happy life together.\n",
            "    *   **Given Name:** It is a common male given name in India, particularly in South India, carrying the positive connotations of longevity, health, and good fortune.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Famous Personality:**\n",
            "    *   **Chiranjeevi (Konidela Siva Sankara Vara Prasad):** This is perhaps the most famous association in modern times. He is a highly prominent **Indian film actor and former politician.**\n",
            "        *   **\"Megastar\" Chiranjeevi** is primarily known for his work in Telugu cinema, where he is considered one of the most influential and successful actors.\n",
            "        *   He has starred in over 150 feature films and has received numerous awards.\n",
            "        *   He also had a significant political career, serving as a Member of Parliament and a Union Minister in the Government of India.\n",
            "        *   His family is a prominent film family in Telugu cinema, with many successful actors like Ram Charan (his son), Allu Arjun, Varun Tej, Sai Dharam Tej, and Vaishnav Tej being related to him.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, \"Chiranjiv\" is a name rich with meaning, cultural significance, and associated with a towering figure in Indian cinema.\n",
